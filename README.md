# OOP-Dart, in this code:
•	We define a Shape class as the parent class, and Circle and Rectangle classes as its subclasses.
•	The Rectangle class implements the Resizable interface and overrides the resize() method.
•	Instances of Circle and Rectangle are initialized with data from JSON strings.
•	We override the toString() method in both subclasses to provide custom string representations.
•	The Rectangle class has a method calculatePerimeter() that demonstrates the use of a loop to calculate the perimeter.
